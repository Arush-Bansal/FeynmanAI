## Usage

The main practice page (`src/app/practice/page.tsx`) demonstrates how to use all these components and hooks together. The page is now much cleaner and more maintainable, with each piece of functionality properly separated into its own module.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component and hook has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused in other parts of the app
3. **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated
5. **Readability**: Code is much easier to understand and navigate
6. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with proper interfaces
